## Project: Medmoriser

Medmoriser is a desktop app to help medical students organise, memorise and revise their content. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=jonfoocy&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Added the ability to hide answers from the main view.
    * What it does: Allows the user to hide the answer when browsing the list of Q&As
        1. `list` which allows to user to view all Q&As, with questions and answers all visible.
        2. `list questions` which allows the user to view all Q&As, with questions visible and answers hidden.
    * Justification: Gives the user the flexibility to choose the preferred mode of viewing, 
    and to prevent seeing the answer before quizzing.
    * Added additional test cases to suit the new functionality.
