## Project: AddressBook Level 3

Medmoriser is a desktop app to help medical students organise, memorise and revise their content. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=chengjiyuqing)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Created new GUI component QuizCard to acommodate Quiz command, Answer command, Endquiz command and Next command
