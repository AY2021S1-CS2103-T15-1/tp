## Project: Medmoriser

Medmoriser is a desktop app to help medical students organise, memorise and revise their content. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a quiz feature for users to test themselves.
  * What it does: allows user to quiz themselves to test their memory on the answers to the questions
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because our app utilizes active recall to help users to memorise their content.
  * Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it was an entirely new feature on its own. 
  * Credits: -
  
* **New Feature**: Added an answer feature for users to answer the quiz question.

* **New Feature**: Added an end quiz feature when users are done with the quiz.
